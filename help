You are using Cardbasecli (Cardbase command line interface).
This tool is designed to facilitate adding and removing new cards as they are added to or removed from the physical collection.


Load a Cardbase

To use, first make sure to load the cardbase by passing it as the first argument to the program, e.g. cardbasecli ~/mycardbase.cb. To start a new clean cardbase, simply run cardbasecli.


Adding Cards

To add cards, first use "set" to enter the code of the set to which the card belongs, e.g. to add 2015 Core Set cards, enter "set M15". To see a list of all valid set codes, type "sets".
Once a set is selected, simply type the card's set number and it will be added to the collection. You may add more of the same card by typing in the same set number multiple times, or by specifying the quantity following the set number.

For example, to add 3 M15 edition Shivan Dragons, do:

> set m15
> 281 3


Removing Cards

To remove cards, first choose a set and then type "remove" followed by the card's set number. To remove two "copies" of the same card, add the desired count after the card number.

For example, to remove 2 of your 3 M15 Shivan Dragons, do:

> set m15
> remove 281 2


Viewing the Cardbase

Cardbasecli also offers some very basic commands to view the current state of the cardbase: glance, peruse and diff.

glance: prints a list showing the amount of each card in the cardbase, by name.
peruse: prints the same list as glance, but with more information about each card.
diff: prints a concise list of added and remove cards and amounts, *since the last write*.

Peruse optionally accepts a card number as an argument. If present, the card's entire information set is printed.
 

Committing Changes and Exiting

Any changes made on this tool must be manually written to the file. If you make a mistake, simply exit and your cardbase will not be modified. To write changes, simply type "write".
To exit, simply type "exit".
